# Terminal-Video-Player
 
![](ExampleImage.jpg)

**Update Jan 24**: I have massively improved the performance on all platforms. Windows supports native colored playback of bad apple out of the box depending on hardware.
Linux supports native colored playback at 720p or up depending on hardware. Linux does not support audio though.

 This was a school project, the code is not clean, nor is it efficient. I have no intention of maintaining the codebase, but it is simple enough it should not be a problem.
 
 # Usage
 
 Place a video file in the same folder as these files, then run main.py, and type the filename.
